      -Human movement is predictable
      -measure entropy of trajectory
      -Entropy: most fundamental quantity capturing degree of predictability of a time series [24]
      -measuring predictability: PI
        -fano's inequality
        -if user w entropy S moves between N locations, then PI < PI^{max}(S<N)
            -PI^Max = S = H(PI^max)log2(N-1) w/binary entropy fn H(PI^max) = -PI^max log2(PI^max)-(1-PI^max)log2(1-PI_max)
            -for user with PI^max = .2, 80% of time the individual chooses location in random fashion (only predictable 20% of the time)
