Rush Limbaugh
RUSH: Larry in Indianapolis, you're next on the EIB Network. Hello.CALLER: Hi, Rush. Thank you for taking my call.RUSH: You bet, sir! Any time.CALLER: I have a suggestion. On your website, I suggest you add a new CALLER: Yes, I know. (snickers)RUSH: So I'll have to consider that. But it's a great idea, 'cause SNERDLEY: (interruption)RUSH: What, I can't let that stand?CALLER: Yeah. Well, there's things in the past that I'd like to have access to --RUSH: Well, I understand, 'cause we've had three of 'em just this week. We've had three of these See, I Told You So's with audio proof and the predictions and all that. It's actually a great idea.CALLER: Now, you might also call it EIB's Freshman Orientation. It would be a good intro to somebody starting to listen to you.RUSH: Yeah, EIB Freshman Orientation.CALLER: Okay.RUSH: I kind of like that. I like the thought behind that.CALLER: Okay.I said underpaid?Yeah, they think they're underpaid.No, it is a good idea.I'm just teasing the highly overrated staff. The staff went out, and they've even had some of their own shirts printed, "Highly Overrated Staff: Excellence in Broadcasting Network." They're having fun with it. But I like that idea. It does have potential, especially to help the new arrivals wade through all the falsehoods. You know, "Here's proof that what you're hearing about this program is wrong and here's proof that what you will hear on this program is true and accurate and right."Larry, I appreciate the call.
