Rush Limbaugh
RUSH: Mere moments ago at La Casa Blanca, Josh Earnest did the daily press briefing. I guess Carney's at the Red Sox game. I don't know where he's gone. During the Q&A;, Ed Henry of Fox News said to the White House press secretary, Josh Earnest, ""The president himself in 2008, when this person donated $1,000 to that cause, also was against same-sex marriage. Does the White House think that, even thought the president has 'evolved' on this issue and now supports same-sex marriage, that there should be tolerance on the issue and that there should be other views heard?"RUSH: No, of course not! Absolutely! We're not gonna weigh in on the decisions of a private company. You can bet that if Brendan Eich had been removed for supporting same-sex marriage, the White House would have something to say. Hobby Lobby is a private company, and I think the White House has said things about it. The Catholic Church is a self-contained church; they've had a lot to say about the Catholic Church.Fox News is a private company, and Obama has had a lot to say about Fox News. I am a private citizen. They've had a lot to say about me. Obama can't even pretend to be on the side of tolerance, not even once? They have to run away from this. They didn't decline comment on Sandra Fluke. They didn't decline comment on Trayvon Martin. They didn't decline comment on Jason Collins."Well, I certainly understand why an issue like this has been on the news and why a lot of you are talking about it. But I'm not gonna be in a position to weigh in on decisions made by a private company like this." The decision wasn't made by a private company; that's the whole point. That is the entire whole point!
