Rush Limbaugh
RUSH: I mentioned this, too, at the top of the program and I want to spend just a little bit more time on it. "Before the Obama administration gave an inaccurate narrative on national television that the Benghazi attacks grew from an anti-American protest --" Before, this is the key. Before anybody from the Regime went on TV. It could be Obama, could be Hillary, Susan Rice, doesn't matter, whoever, before anybody in the Regime went on TV and blamed what happened in Benghazi on a videotape that caused protests and riots, before anybody said that, "the CIAs station chief in Libya pointedly told his superiors in Washington that no such demonstration occurred.When Obama and Hillary and Susan Rice blamed that video is when the world said, "What video?" and went and found it, and then the protests began. Obama and Hillary and Susan Rice essentially caused additional protests, but they were told long before they went out and said that by the CIA station chief in Libya that no such demonstrations occurred. This was the result of testimony, documents, and interviews with current and former intelligence officials.
