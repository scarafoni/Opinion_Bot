Rush Limbaugh
RUSH: OBAMA: My day started with the great honor of meeting His Holiness, Pope Francis. I've been incredibly moved by his compassion, his message of inclusion. Uh, I was grateful to have, uh, the opportunity to speak with him about the responsibilities that we all share to care for "the least of these," uh, the poor, uh, the excluded. Uh, and --RUSH: The excluded?OBAMA: Uh, you know, I was --RUSH: Who the hell is excluded?OBAMA: I was, uh, extremely moved by his insights about, uh, the importance, uh, of us all having, uh, a moral perspective on world problems and not simply thinking in terms of our own narrow self-interests.RUSH: Come on, is anybody buying? He doesn't believe that. It's all about him. Anyway, Obama was moved by "the excluded." By the way, you know, I think that one person applauding in that previous sound bite was probably the White House pool reporter. I think I figured it out. MASTRO: In connection with allegations related to the George Washington Bridge realignment, we found that Governor Christie had no knowledge beforehand of this George Washington Bridge realignment idea and that he played no role whatsoever in that decision or the implementation of it.RUSH: Wow.MASTRO: We further found --RUSH: Yeah?MASTRO: -- no evidence --RUSH: Uh-huh.MASTRO: -- that anyone in the governor's office besides Bridget Kelly --RUSH: Who's gone.RUSH: That's right.MASTRO: -- or played any role in the decision or the implementation of it.RUSH: Okay. So the firm that Governor Christie hired to investigate himself has cleared him of any wrongdoing. Great news for the Democrats. But they cut away from the Obama presser for it. Yes, you heard me right. You heard me right. (chuckling) Yes!
