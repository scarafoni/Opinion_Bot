 It all started when our predictably heroic protagonist, Bill Brasky, woke up in a magical cornfield. It was the second time it had happened. Feeling very exasperated, Bill Brasky backhanded a carrot, thinking it would make her feel better (but as usual, it did not). Absolutely thrilled, she realized that her beloved iPad was missing!  Immediately she called her fundamentalist, guilt-dispensing friend, Leroy Jenkins. Bill Brasky had known Leroy Jenkins for (plus or minus) 550,000 years, the majority of which were sassy ones.  Leroy Jenkins was unique. He was charismatic though sometimes a little... dimwitted. Bill Brasky called him anyway, for the situation was urgent.
   Leroy Jenkins picked up to a very unhappy Bill Brasky. Leroy Jenkins calmly assured her that most albino cats cringe before mating, yet legless puppies usually scandalously yawn *after* mating. He had no idea what that meant; he was only concerned with distracting Bill Brasky.  Why was Leroy Jenkins trying to distract Bill Brasky?  Because he had snuck out from Bill Brasky's with the iPad only seven days prior.  It was a saucy little iPad... how could he resist?
   It didn't take long before Bill Brasky got back to the subject at hand: her iPad. Leroy Jenkins sneezed. Relunctantly, Leroy Jenkins invited her over, assuring her they'd find the iPad. Bill Brasky grabbed her rhinocerus and disembarked immediately. After hanging up the phone, Leroy Jenkins realized that he was in trouble. He had to find a place to hide the iPad and he had to do it recklessly. He figured that if Bill Brasky took the noise-polluting import, he had take at least eleven minutes before Bill Brasky would get there.  But if she took the Segway?  Then Leroy Jenkins would be abundantly screwed.
   Before he could come up with any reasonable ideas, Leroy Jenkins was interrupted by six dimwitted marmots that were lured by his iPad. Leroy Jenkins sneezed; 'Not again', he thought. Feeling frustrated, he aggressively reached for his gerbil and carefully stroked every last one of them. Apparently this was an adequate deterrent--the discouraged critters began to scurry back toward the lemur-infested moor, squealing with discontent. He exhaled with relief.  That's when he heard the Segway rolling up.  It was Bill Brasky.
   As she pulled up, she felt a sense of urgency. She had had to make an unscheduled stop at Big Lots to pick up a 12-pack of potatos, so she knew she was running late.  With a hasty leap, Bill Brasky was out of the Segway and went indiscriminately jaunting toward Leroy Jenkins's front door.  Meanwhile inside,  Leroy Jenkins was panicking.  Not thinking, he tossed the iPad into a box of ninja stars and then slid the box behind his hammock. Leroy Jenkins was relieved but at least the iPad was concealed.  The doorbell rang.
   'Come in,' Leroy Jenkins exotically purred.  With a careful push, Bill Brasky opened the door.  'Sorry for being late, but I was being chased by some funny-smelling beer-sloshed tool in a best-in-its-so-called-'class' sedan,' she lied.  'It's fine,' Leroy Jenkins assured her. Bill Brasky took a seat vaguely close to where Leroy Jenkins had hidden the iPad. Leroy Jenkins turned red trying unsuccessfully to hide his nervousness.  'Uhh, can I get you anything?' he blurted.  But Bill Brasky was distracted. Before the all-seeing eyes of a perpetually displeased diety, Leroy Jenkins noticed a clueless look on Bill Brasky's face. Bill Brasky slowly opened her mouth to speak.
   '...What's that smell?'
   Leroy Jenkins felt a stabbing pain in his scalp when Bill Brasky asked this.  In a moment of disbelief, he realized that he had hidden the iPad right by his oscillating fan. 'Wh-what?  I don't smell anything..!'  A lie.  A clueless look started to form on Bill Brasky's face. She turned to notice a box that seemed clearly out of place. 'Th-th-those are just my grandma's carrots from when she used to have pet Indonesian devil cats.  She, uh...dropped 'em by here earlier'. Bill Brasky nodded with fake acknowledgement...then, before Leroy Jenkins could react, Bill Brasky aimlessly lunged toward the box and opened it.  The iPad was plainly in view.
   Bill Brasky stared at Leroy Jenkins for what what must've been four nanoseconds. Happy as a frickin' monkey, Leroy Jenkins groped flamboyantly in Bill Brasky's direction, clearly desperate. Bill Brasky grabbed the iPad and bolted for the door.  It was locked. Leroy Jenkins let out a curious chuckle. 'If only you hadn't been so protective of that thing, none of this would have happened, Bill Brasky,' he rebuked. Leroy Jenkins always had been a little abrasive, so Bill Brasky knew that reconciliation was not an option; she needed to escape before Leroy Jenkins did something crazy, like... start chucking ripened avocados at him or something. As if it really mattered she gripped her iPad tightly and made a dash toward the window, diving headlong through the glass panels.
   Leroy Jenkins looked on, blankly. 'What the hell?  That seemed excessive.  The other door was open, you know.' Silence from Bill Brasky. 'And to think, I varnished that window frame nine days ago...it never ends!' Suddenly he felt a tinge of concern for Bill Brasky. 'Oh.  You ..okay?' Still silence. Leroy Jenkins walked over to the window and looked down. Bill Brasky was gone.
   Just yonder, Bill Brasky was struggling to make her way through the fanstic pumpkin patch behind Leroy Jenkins's place. Bill Brasky had severely hurt her shin during the window incident, and was starting to lose strength.  Another pack of feral marmots suddenly appeared, having caught wind of the iPad.  One by one they latched on to Bill Brasky.  Already weakened from her injury, Bill Brasky yielded to the furry onslaught and collapsed.  The last thing she saw before losing consciousness was a buzzing horde of marmots running off with her iPad.
   But then God came down with His attractive smile and restored Bill Brasky's iPad. Feeling stunned, God smote the marmots for their injustice.  Then He got in His wannabe go-fast Civic and bolted away with the fortitude of  61 man-eating capybaras running from a little pack of albino cats. Bill Brasky fell with joy when she saw this. Her iPad was safe. It was a good thing, too, because in eleven minutes her favorite TV show,  Two and a Half Men, was going to come on (followed immediately by 'When legless puppies meet hand grenade'). Bill Brasky was pleased. And so, everyone except Leroy Jenkins and a few pipe bomb-toting South American hissing sloths lived blissfully happy, forever after.
