How many of you watch network news?

Okay now how many of you watch those opinion shows?
if multiple people raise their hands:
	Ok neat, so can you guys do me a favor, I wanna illustrate a cool statistic for you about the news:
	SO take your left hand, right? now place if over your right. So notice how you now have ten fingers all on the same hand? Ok now fold down all the fingers that you use to point at things? See all the finger's left? Ok see you guys will believe anything, learn to think for yourself, JEEZ

else:
	well thank God

Anyway, the rest of you may have gone to your grandparents house and noticed that the things pundits say can be a little formulaic. We thought it might be interesting to see if they were so simple that you could recreate them with some simple AI.

Enter Opinion_Bot. Opinion_Bot uses a simple trigram hidden markov model to reconstruct sentences based on a corpus of text. We have two existing "personalities" as it were: rush limbot and michael_bloombot, trained off of text from Rush limbaugh's radio show and msnbc.com respectively. We also have a script that allows them to have a debate: everything they say is fed into the other bots knowledge base, which means that they will, with time, graviate towards certain topics! Lets watch and see!

As you can see, just like in real life, these two personalities don't stray too much from their views -- and they also don't really make sense.
